 roberts v soldiers sailors airmen and families association is a judicial decision of the english court of appeal in relation to the proper law to govern contribution claims in cross border torts the plaintiff harry roberts was born in germany and alleged that he had been injured as a result of the alleged negligence of the soldiers sailors airmen and families association the ssafa at the time of his birth through his mother he brought legal proceedings against the ssafa and the ministry of defence in the united kingdom the ssafa and the ministry of defence then served third party contribution notices on the german hospital alleging that if there was fault in the birth of harry roberts the hospital was partially responsible all parties agreed that any tort which had occurred would be governed by german law the german hospital argued that any right of third party contribution against it was barred because under german law the relevant limitation period had expired however the ssafa and the ministry of defence argued that the right of contribution was governed not by german law but by english law instead where the limitation period had not yet expired the court of appeal unanimously ruled that the contribution claim was to be determined by english law and so the relevant limitation period had not expired facts harry roberts was born on june in the allegemeines krankenhaus in viersen north rhine westphalia germany which was a hospital providing medical services to families and members of uk armed forces in which his father was a serving member the plaintiffs claimed that harry suffered an acute profound hypoxic brain injury his injuries were severe he had level cerebral palsy and had no independent mobility and was confined to a wheelchair he brought legal proceedings in england through his mother as litigation friend even though he was over at the time the claim was brought his mental condition resulted in him being a protected party under the english civil procedure rules he alleged that the negligent failings of the midwife who attended his mother labour in the latter stages and who is employed by the ssafa caused his injuries the defendants disputed liability but issued proceedings against the german hospital that in the event they were found to be liable that the hospital should make a contribution to the damages under part of the civil procedure rules the german hospital disputed liability as well and further argued that as against them the limitation period had expired under german law under the private international law miscellaneous provisions act which applied at the time any alleged tort was governed by german law however in the english courts any right of contribution was governed by the civil liability contribution act and it was argued that the act mandated english law to govern the contribution claims even though german law governed the tort claims accordingly as a preliminary issue it had to be determined which law governed the contribution claim the preliminary issue was agreed by the parties and certified by master yoxall in following terms the relevant question for the purposes of the trial of the preliminary issue is whether or not the act has mandatory or overriding effect and applies automatically to all proceedings for contribution brought in england and wales without reference to any choice of law rules if not german law will apply to the defendants claims for contribution against the part defendant and they will be time barred high court in the high court the preliminary issue came before mrs justice foster who ruled that the civil liability contribution act mandated the application of english law to the contribution claims and thus the proceedings against the german hospital could continue in england even though they were statute barred in germany court of appeal lead judgment in the court of appeal the lead judgment was given by lord justice irwin he began by summarising the facts and then discussing the background to the act he then considered the various authorities relating to the act and the issue of the proper law to govern contribution claims he noted that the editors of dicey morris amp collins edition expressed the view that the proper law of the claim would govern the contribution claim as well he also reviewed the only decision on the point the first instance decision of chadwick j in arab monetary fund v hashim the times october in that decision chadwick j had held that the effect of the civil liability contribution act was to apply english law to all contribution claims irrespective of the law which governed the underlying liability he noted that the decision in hashim had been subject to a great deal of academic criticism including most notably by professor adrian briggs writing in the lloyd commercial and maritime law quarterly who attacked the decision stating the blanket application of english law to the substance of the contribution claim is inappropriate and criticising the inevitable anarchy of separated parts of a single story irwin lj also noted that other academic commentators had also been critical including professor robert stevens and dr charles mitchell he further noted that the law commission of england and wales had prior to the decision in hashim expressed the view that contribution claims should also be governed by the proper law of the underlying claim he then turned to the interpretation of the civil liability contribution act itself he noted that there was a presumption that statutes were not intended to have extra territorial effect clark inspector of taxes v oceanic contractors inc ac at the issue he held involved not one question but two firstly what is the proper law of the liability in question and secondly whether that choice of law is overridden by the mandatory rules of the forum a statute could be given such effect either expressly or by implication he cited lord sumption in at para that for a statute to have overriding effect by implication it would be necessary that i the terms of the legislation cannot effectually be applied or its purpose cannot effectually be achieved unless it has extra territorial effect or ii the legislation gives effect to a policy so significant in the law of the forum that parliament must be assumed to have intended that policy to apply to any one resorting to an english court regardless of the law that would otherwise apply in construing the legislation irwin lj felt the decisive issues were the references in sections and c which referred expressly to foreign law in particular section provided it is immaterial whether any issue arising in any such action was or would be determined in accordance with the rules of private international law by reference to the law of a country outside england and wales he noted that section also stated that the act superseded any right which he construed to include any right under foreign law taken as a whole he formed the view that the act was intended to have overriding application and apply english law to the issue of contribution in all cases concurring judgments both the other members of the court gave short supporting judgments phillips lj summarised the decision the creation of i a statutory right of contribution as between persons notwithstanding that the liability of one or more of them arises under foreign law and ii the exclusion of other rights of contribution save for express contractual rights can and should be read together as giving rise to the plain implication that the act has extraterritorial effect david richard lj agreed with the other two members of the court that the appeal should be dismissed and that it was inescapable that the act is intended to have extra territorial effect in the sense that claims lie under it even though applying the principles of private international law they would be governed by a foreign law but he disagreed with the other two members of the court in that he did not view section as definitive he viewed that section as supporting either conclusion supreme court permission to appeal to the supreme court has been granted the appeal is expected to be heard in the spring of commentary the case was reviewed in the law quarterly review commenting that f rom the point of view of the conflict of laws the result could fairly be characterised as disappointing and noting the disparity that this creates between choice of law rules for contribution claims against a third party on the hand which will always be determined by english law and contributory negligence claims against the plaintiff on the other which will be determined by the governing law of the tort or contract it also expressed concern that the decision in roberts would still be regarded as good law under the subsequent rome ii regulation rules because of the effect of article a blog post by professor andrew tettenborn referred to the ruling in critical terms stating the decision will hardly do much for comity nor does the result make much sense as part of a sensible scheme of private international law since where it applies it is an open invitation to come and do some socially distanced forum shopping in england however he added that the decision was of limited importance as it related to the private international law miscellaneous provisions act and expressed the view that the rome ii regulation which would now apply would probably produce a different outcome another article noted t his is an important decision with significant practical effect for clinical negligence litigation involving contribution claims in an international context but cautioned this case was not governed by the rome ii regulation 
 nascar engine nascar the highest governing body and top level division for stock car racing has used a range of different types of engine configurations and displacements over its year history since its inaugural season in the engines are currently used in the cup series xfinity series camping world truck series and the whelen modified tour overview the cars are currently powered by efi v engines since after years using carburetion as engine fuel feed with compacted graphite iron blocks and pushrod valvetrains actuating two valves per cylinder and are limited to a cubic inch liter displacement the sprint cup season was the last complete cup season with carbureted engines at the end of the season nascar announced that it would change to an electronic fuel injection system for the racing season nxs cars do however continue to use carburetors however modern technology has allowed power outputs near in unrestricted form while retaining the conventional basic engine design in fact before nascar instituted the gear rule cup engines were capable of operating more than rpm a nascar cup series engine with the maximum bore of and stroke of at rpm has a mean piston speed of fps m s contemporary cup engines run rpm fps m s at the road course events on pocono raceway long front stretch and at martinsville speedway a mile short track at the backbone to mile tri oval tracks of nascar the engines produce over hp running rpm for miles mi for the coca cola charlotte race the current nascar cup engines curb weight is roughly at the oldsmobile rocket v with a displacement of is widely recognized as the first postwar modern overhead valve ohv engine to become available to the public the oldsmobile was an immediate success in and and all the automobile manufacturers could not help noticing the higher sales of the oldsmobile to the buying public the motto of the day became win on sunday sell on monday at the time it typically took three years for a new engine design to end up in production and be available for nascar racing most cars sold to the public did not have a wide variety of engine choices and the majority of the buying public at the time was not interested in the large displacement special edition engine options that would soon become popular however the end of the korean war in started an economic boom and then car buyers immediately began demanding more powerful engines the oldsmobile was an immediate success in and and all the automobile manufacturers could not help noticing that its victories resulted in noticeably higher sales of the oldsmobile to the buying public the motto of the day became win on sunday sell on monday during the early days of stock car racing more horsepower ultimately meant more wins the sleek and aerodynamic hudson hornet managed to win in and using a flat head inline six cylinder engine in chrysler produced the c with its chrysler firepower engine ohv engine which easily won in and in chevrolet sold enough of their new fuel injected engines to the public in order to make them available for racing and ford began selling superchargers as an option but bill france immediately banned fuel injection and superchargers from nascar before they could race however even without official factory support or the use of fuel injection buck baker won in driving a small block v chevrolet bel air in ford introduced the f in a low drag galaxie starliner but and championships were won by drivers in powered chevrolet impalas pontiac introduced their super duty in catalinas that made use of many aluminum body parts to save weight and the pontiacs easily won in it became apparent that manufacturers were willing to produce increasingly larger engines to remain competitive ford had developed a they hoped to race for the season nascar engines were restricted to using a maximum displacement of and using only two valves per cylinder then in the new chrysler hemi engine so dominated the series in a plymouth belvedere sport fury the homologation rules were changed so that of any engine and car had to be sold to the public to qualify as a stock part instead of just this made the hemi unavailable for the season in ford adapted two single overhead cams to their fe v to allow it to run at a higher rpm called the ford cammer ford started to sell cammers to the public to homologate it mostly to dealer sponsored privateer drag racers but nascar changed the rules to specify that all nascar engines must use a single cam in block but even without the cammer the ford fe won in in the past nascar xfinity series competitors made use of less powerful v engines instead of cup series v in nascar changed rules requiring cars to use current body styles similar to the cup cars however the cars still used v engines the cars gradually became similar to cup cars was the final year that v engines were used in the busch series in changes were made the series switched to v power with a compression ratio of as opposed to for cup at the time the introduction of v made the two series cars increasingly similar for the nascar cup series power output of the competing cars ranged from to hp to kw the current engines are limited to on tracks mile or below on tracks greater than one mile modern contemporary nascar engines are capable of producing well over hp cu in up to hp cu in next gen nascar engines will be even less powerful they will be rated at for restrictor plate racing and for all other tracks including road courses short tracks and ovals up to the size of darlington raceway and nashville superspeedway nascar is due to switch to hybrid powertrains in nascar whelen modified tour nascar whelen modified tour series stock cars are powered by small block v engines usually of of displacement although larger or smaller engines can be used engine components are largely similar to those used in the cup series but whelen modified tour engines use a small four barrel carburetor rated at per minute about half the airflow of previous modified carburetors which limits their output to on large tracks such as new hampshire motor speedway the engines must have a restrictor plate between the carburetor and intake manifold reducing engine power and car speed for safety reasons restrictor plates as a safety measure to reduce speeds at the two high banked superspeedways daytona and talladega restrictor plates are used there are some tracks however where restrictor plates are not mandated and therefore see faster speeds specifically atlanta motor speedway and texas motor speedway while atlanta is generally considered the fastest track restrictor plates are not mandated there in and higher qualifying speeds were posted at texas earning it the title of the circuit fastest track unrestricted sprint cup cars produce over horsepower kw and can run at speeds in excess of mph rusty wallace completed a test for nascar at talladega in which he used an unrestricted motor to complete average lap speeds of and top speeds near the width is inch this is the largest carburetor restrictor plate opening since the one inch mandate in the first year the horsepower reducing plates were used in the cup series at daytona unfortunately the restrictor plates have an unintended effect on the race because of the reduced horsepower of the cars the cars form large packs during a race it is not uncommon to see thirty or more lead changes during a race this also is the source of the big one when a driver crashes usually they take that pack with them during the coke zero of the cars crashed this is a safety concern that has puzzled nascar however an unexpected consequence of the introduction of the car of tomorrow and re paving of daytona and talladega track surfaces has been the separation of the pack into two car pairs since the season nascar cup cars now have fuel injection instead of carburetors but restrictor plates are still being used beginning in nascar rewrote the rules to effectively force the ford and chrysler specialty cars out of the competition by limiting them to i the cars affected by this rule include the ford talladega mercury spoiler ii dodge charger dodge charger daytona and the plymouth superbird this rule was so effective in limiting performance that only one car that season ever attempted to run in this configuration in nascar handicapped the larger engines with a restrictor plate by nascar phased in a rule to lower the maximum engine displacement from cubic inches liters to its present cubic inches liters the transition was not complete until and coincided with american manufacturers ending factory support of racing and the oil crisis after a series of flips and dangerous crashes in the nascar began requiring all cars to run a restrictor plate at daytona and talladega the restrictor plate limits air into the engine reducing horsepower and speed at these tracks from mph to mph at these races in addition to the restrictor plate there are a variety of other technical rules and regulations to keep the cars stable and on the track in addition to these technical rules restrictor plate races and road courses are the only races where nascar enforces track limits at the high speed superspeedways track limits are marked by a double yellow line separating the apron from the racing surface exceeding track limits to advance one position is subject to a drive through penalty or if the foul occurs on the last lap that car will be relegated to the last car on the lead lap in official race results the superspeedway track limits often referred as the yellow line rule have been part of considerable criticism and controversies such as when regan smith was stripped of second place finish at the amp energy following a last lap pass attempt that went below the line and controversies surrounding the finish of the yellawood with former drivers turned television coverage pundits dale jarrett and dale earnhardt jr the latter being involved in a track limits controversy at the aaron calling for the repeal of the rule if track limits are violated on road courses such as not making a chicane enforced at watkins glen daytona and charlotte road courses drivers must stop at an assigned point of the circuit or face a drive through penalty the nascar cup series and xfinity series mandated the use of restrictor plates at daytona international speedway and talladega superspeedway from to the plates were put into use in as a result of a wreck in the winston at talladega that involved the car of bobby allison crashing into the front stretch catch fence at a high enough speed to destroy almost feet of the fence and put the race under a red flag condition for two hours the following race at talladega that year would be run with a smaller carburetor however nascar mandated the use of the restrictor plate at the end of the season the restrictions are in the interest of driver and fan safety because speeds higher than the mph range used for daytona and talladega risk cars turning over through sheer aerodynamic forces alone the severity of crashes at higher speeds is also much greater shown by telemetry readings of wrecks such as elliott sadler at pocono raceway and michael mcdowell at texas motor speedway that were far higher than registered on restrictor plate tracks drivers such as rusty wallace have cited data showing that the roof flaps used on the cars cannot keep them on the ground above mph the drawback to the use of the restrictor plates has been the increased size of packs of cars caused by the decreased power coupled with the drag the vehicles naturally produce at daytona and talladega most races are marred by at least one wreck usually referred to as the big one as cars rarely become separated talladega has been considered the more likely track for these instances to occur as the track is incredibly wide enough to have three to four distinct lines of cars running side by side with the new pavement at daytona three wide racing became far easier and multi car wrecks became more common the daytona saw a record number of cautions including an early car pile up these wrecks tend to be singled out for criticism despite multicar crashes at other tracks and the generally greater severity of impact on non restricted tracks in addition the packs were far smaller in through until more teams mastered the nuances of this kind of racing and improved their cars and drivers accordingly the sprint cup season was the last complete cup season with carbureted engines at the end of the season nascar announced that it would change to an electronic fuel injection system for the racing season the injection system used by nascar is a different system from that used in indycar racing and other motorsports series the efi system that nascar put into use was compatible with the old restrictor plates allowing nascar to continue to use them to keep the speeds lower at the superspeedways and save costs for race teams the restrictor plates were bolted beneath a throttle body that sits in the same place as the former carburetors tapered spacers have been used in nascar cup series since when a inch aluminum block reduced horsepower from about to approximately at several tracks the rules package mandates those same sized spacers at all tracks less than miles a inch spacer will be used at all oval tracks miles and above which will decrease engine horsepower to about the last race with the original restrictor plates was the daytona after that race the cars moved to a variable sized tapered spacer already used at all other tracks with the exception that the spacer would have smaller holes than the ones used at the smaller tracks to ensure speeds stay under mph the shape of the spacer helps a car funnel more air smoothly into the manifold increasing fuel performance while ensuring airflow is still restricted with that change nascar also mandated the use of larger rear spoilers larger front splitters and specially placed front end aero ducts the combination of those features increased drag on the cars counteracting the increased horsepower keeping the cars close to the speeds they were running prior to the switch to the tapered spacer while the racing quality noticeably improved and passing was made easier with larger horsepower and bigger runs speeds also noticeably increased past mph and even into mph ranges reason for restrictor plates there have been four eras that nascar used restrictor plates the first use came in as part of a transition from the seven liter era cubic inch to the six liter era cubic inch engine following testing and input from drivers such as david pearson bobby isaac and bobby allison nascar mandated the use of a restrictor plate for the big block seven liter engines small block engines in the cubic inch range were exempt from the plates the first car to race with a small block engine was dick brooks at the daytona where he ran a dodge daytona with a cid engine the transition period lasted until when the current cubic inch limit was imposed and nascar eliminated the cubic inch engine as the early use of restrictor plates was considered a transitional process and as not every car used restrictor plates this is not what most fans call restrictor plate racing the second use came following the crash of bobby allison at the winston at talladega superspeedway allison buick lesabre blew a tire going into the tri oval at spun around and became airborne flying tail first into the catch fencing while the car did not enter the grandstands it tore down nearly feet of fencing and flying debris injured several spectators after a summer where the two subsequent superspeedway races were run with smaller carburetors cubic feet per minute cfm instead of cfm proved to be inadequate to sufficiently slow the cars nascar imposed restrictor plates again this time at the two fastest circuits both superspeedways daytona for all nascar sanctioned races and talladega for cup races the automobile racing club of america also enforced restrictor plates at their events at the two tracks in when the busch grand national series began racing at talladega the plates were implemented in keeping with their use at daytona nascar concerns with speeds because of power to weight ratios result in restrictor plates at other tracks the goody dash series known now as the iscars series with its new ownership used restrictor plates at bristol during at least the last years of the series existence when the cars were using six cylinder engines compared to the traditional four cylinder engines in addition to their daytona races however restrictor plates were not initially used for camping world truck series trucks rather aerodynamic air intake reduction through the use of a cfm carburetor and eventually a tapered carburetor spacer was implemented for those races combined with the aerodynamic disadvantage of the trucks this allowed nascar to avoid the use of such equipment for the trucks until in the nationwide series now known as xfinity series and truck series began implementation of tapered spacers in the engines to restrict power compared to sprint cup cars at all nns and ncts races both these nascar series now use a restrictor plate and tapered spacer at the two tracks the third use came in following fatal crashes of adam petty and kenny irwin jr at the new hampshire international speedway during the may busch series and july winston cup series races respectively nascar adopted a one inch cm restrictor plate to slow the cars headed towards the tight turns as part of a series of reforms to alleviate stuck throttle problems which were alleged to have caused both fatal crashes for the winston cup race it was used just once at the dura lube jeff burton led all laps in the ensuing race despite a car two abreast battle in the first ten laps a dramatic charge past cars in laps by john andretti who finished seventh and two charges by bobby labonte in the final laps where he took the lead but burton beat him back to the stripe the use of restrictor plates intended as an emergency measure pending a more permanent replacement in any event was discontinued at new hampshire for the following race for cup only however the modifieds still use a restrictor plate because the speeds are too great for that class of racecar without them the track has since been changed with safer barriers to improve racing safety restrictor plates remain a permanent fixture on the modifieds and the racing has often broken official lead changes for laps of competition rusty wallace tested a car at talladega superspeedway without a restrictor plate in reaching a top speed of in the backstretch and a one lap average of while admitting excitement at the achievement wallace also conceded there no way we could be out there racing at those speeds it would be insane to think we could have a pack of cars out there doing that in following a series of uncompetitive races at indianapolis motor speedway nascar began a series of tests for the xfinity series using a smaller restrictor plate than used at daytona and talladega and aerodynamic aids after the tests were successful the rules package was imposed for the race at indianapolis for the package is being used at indianapolis michigan and pocono for the xfinity series and in the all star race in the cup series the competitive quality of restrictor plate racing a frequent criticism of restrictor plates is the enormous size of packs in the racing with big one wrecks as noted above singled out for condemnation despite the greater violence of smaller crashes on unrestricted tracks in restrictor plate racing the packs have brought about an often enormous increase in positional passing at talladega superspeedway the sprint cup cars have broken official lead changes sixteen times from onward including both sprint cup races at talladega which had official lead changes in the regulation laps the aaron had lead changes but the the race winning pass by kevin harvick was on the last lap of the third attempt at a green white checkered finish daytona international speedway has generally been less competitive because the age of the asphalt the track was repaved in and again in has reduced grip for the cars and thus handling has impeded passing ability to a significant extent the new hampshire race was condemned because jeff burton led wire to wire the plates were singled out as impeding the ability to pass a criticism contradicted by the use of restrictor plates in a busch north support race the day before where the lead changed seven times in laps and by the highly competitive nature of restrictor plated modified races as noted above the also saw a car battle for third in the first ten laps and a burst by cars from john andretti the criticism stems from the reduction in throttle response brought by the restriction the reduction in throttle response however has never been shown to have impeded the ability to pass the criticism was shot down in the first modern plate race the daytona as the lead changed times officially and saw several bursts where the lead changed several times a lap and also several bursts of sustained side by side racing notably in the final laps between bobby allison darrell waltrip neil bonnett and buddy baker said waltrip before the race i feel as a driver now i can do more than i could before the plates now instead of a car just blasting by me with a burst of speed and a lot of horsepower he got to think his way he got to drive his way around me in the transitional years where the seven liter engines cu in had restrictor plates daytona and talladega broke official lead changes six times while michigan international speedway broke official lead changes in both of its races
