for a statute to have override effect by implication it would be necessary that i the term of the legislation can not effectually be apply or its purpose can not effectually be achieve unless it have extra territorial effect or ii the legislation give effect to a policy so significant in the law of the forum that parliament must be assume to have intend that policy to apply to any one resort to an english court regardless of the law that would otherwise apply in construe the legislation irwin lj feel the decisive issue be the reference in section and c which refer expressly to foreign law in particular section provide it be immaterial whether any issue arise in any such action be or would be determine in accordance with the rule of private international law by reference to the law of a country outside england and wale he note that section also state that the act supersede any right which he construe to include any right under foreign law take as a whole he form the view that the act be intend to have override application and apply english law to the issue of contribution in all case concur judgment both the other member of the court give short support judgment phillip lj summarise the decision the creation of i a statutory right of contribution as between person notwithstanding that the liability of one or more of they arise under foreign law and ii the exclusion of other right of contribution save for express contractual right can and should be read together as give rise to the plain implication that the act have extraterritorial effect david richard lj agree with the other two member of the court that the appeal should be dismiss and that it be inescapable that the act be intend to have extra territorial effect in the sense that claim lie under it even though apply the principle of private international law they would be govern by a foreign law but he disagree with the other two member of the court in that he do not view section as definitive he view that section as support either conclusion supreme court permission to appeal to the supreme court have be grant the appeal be expect to be hear in the spring of commentary the case be review in the law quarterly review comment that f rom the point of view of the conflict of law the result could fairly be characterise as disappointing and note the disparity that this create between choice of law rule for contribution claim against a third party on the hand which will always be determine by english law and contributory negligence claim against the plaintiff on the other which will be determine by the govern law of the tort or contract it also express concern that the decision in robert would still be regard as good law under the subsequent rome ii regulation rule because of the effect of article a blog post by professor andrew tettenborn refer to the ruling in critical term state the decision will hardly do much for comity nor do the result make much sense as part of a sensible scheme of private international law since where it apply it be an open invitation to come and do some socially distance forum shopping in england however he add that the decision be of limited importance as it relate to the private international law miscellaneous provision act and express the view that the rome ii regulation which would now apply would probably produce a different outcome another article note t his be an important decision with significant practical effect for clinical negligence litigation involve contribution claim in an international context but caution this case be not govern by the rome ii regulation 
  nascar engine nascar the high govern body and top level division for stock car racing have use a range of different type of engine configuration and displacement over its year history since its inaugural season in the engine be currently use in the cup series xfinity series camp world truck series and the whelen modified tour overview the car be currently power by efi v engine since after year use carburetion as engine fuel feed with compact graphite iron block and pushrod valvetrain actuate two valve per cylinder and be limit to a cubic inch liter displacement the sprint cup season be the last complete cup season with carburet engine at the end of the season nascar announce that it would change to an electronic fuel injection system for the racing season nxs car do however continue to use carburetor however modern technology have allow power output near in unrestricted form while retain the conventional basic engine design in fact before nascar institute the gear rule cup engine be capable of operate more than rpm a nascar cup series engine with the maximum bore of and stroke of at rpm have a mean piston speed of fps m s contemporary cup engine run rpm fps m s at the road course event on pocono raceway long front stretch and at martinsville speedway a mile short track at the backbone to mile tri oval track of nascar the engine produce over hp run rpm for mile mi for the coca cola charlotte race the current nascar cup engine curb weight be roughly at the oldsmobile rocket v with a displacement of be widely recognize as the first postwar modern overhead valve ohv engine to become available to the public the oldsmobile be an immediate success in and and all the automobile manufacturer could not help notice the high sale of the oldsmobile to the buying public the motto of the day become win on sunday sell on monday at the time it typically take three year for a new engine design to end up in production and be available for nascar race most car sell to the public do not have a wide variety of engine choice and the majority of the buying public at the time be not interested in the large displacement special edition engine option that would soon become popular however the end of the korean war in start an economic boom and then car buyer immediately begin demand more powerful engine the oldsmobile be an immediate success in and and all the automobile manufacturer could not help notice that its victory result in noticeably high sale of the oldsmobile to the buying public the motto of the day become win on sunday sell on monday during the early day of stock car race more horsepower ultimately mean more win the sleek and aerodynamic hudson hornet manage to win in and use a flat head inline six cylinder engine in chrysler produce the c with its chrysler firepower engine ohv engine which easily win in and in chevrolet sell enough of their new fuel inject engine to the public in order to make they available for racing and ford begin sell supercharger as an option but bill france immediately ban fuel injection and supercharger from nascar before they could race however even without official factory support or the use of fuel injection buck baker win in drive a small block v chevrolet bel air in ford introduce the f in a low drag galaxie starliner but and championship be win by driver in powered chevrolet impala pontiac introduce their super duty in catalinas that make use of many aluminum body part to save weight and the pontiac easily win in it become apparent that manufacturer be willing to produce increasingly large engine to remain competitive ford have develop a they hope to race for the season nascar engine be restrict to use a maximum displacement of and use only two valve per cylinder then in the new chrysler hemi engine so dominate the series in a plymouth belvedere sport fury the homologation rule be change so that of any engine and car have to be sell to the public to qualify as a stock part instead of just this make the hemi unavailable for the season in ford adapt two single overhead cam to their fe v to allow it to run at a high rpm call the ford cammer ford start to sell cammer to the public to homologate it mostly to dealer sponsor privateer drag racer but nascar change the rule to specify that all nascar engine must use a single cam in block but even without the cammer the ford fe win in in the past nascar xfinity series competitor make use of less powerful v engine instead of cup series v in nascar change rule require car to use current body style similar to the cup car however the car still use v engine the car gradually become similar to cup car be the final year that v engine be use in the busch series in change be make the series switch to v power with a compression ratio of as oppose to for cup at the time the introduction of v make the two series car increasingly similar for the nascar cup series power output of the compete car range from to hp to kw the current engine be limit to on track mile or below on track great than one mile modern contemporary nascar engine be capable of produce well over hp cu in up to hp cu in next gen nascar engine will be even less powerful they will be rate at for restrictor plate racing and for all other track include road course short track and oval up to the size of darlington raceway and nashville superspeedway nascar be due to switch to hybrid powertrain in nascar whelen modify tour nascar whelen modify tour series stock car be power by small block v engine usually of of displacement although large or small engine can be use engine component be largely similar to those use in the cup series but whelen modify tour engine use a small four barrel carburetor rate at per minute about half the airflow of previous modify carburetor which limit their output to on large track such as new hampshire motor speedway the engine must have a restrictor plate between the carburetor and intake manifold reduce engine power and car speed for safety reason restrictor plate as a safety measure to reduce speed at the two high banked superspeedway daytona and talladega restrictor plate be use there be some track however where restrictor plate be not mandate and therefore see fast speed specifically atlanta motor speedway and texas motor speedway while atlanta be generally consider the fast track restrictor plate be not mandate there in and high qualifying speed be post at texas earn it the title of the circuit fast track unrestricted sprint cup car produce over horsepower kw and can run at speed in excess of mph rusty wallace complete a test for nascar at talladega in which he use an unrestricted motor to complete average lap speed of and top speed near the width be inch this be the large carburetor restrictor plate opening since the one inch mandate in the first year the horsepower reduce plate be use in the cup series at daytona unfortunately the restrictor plate have an unintended effect on the race because of the reduced horsepower of the car the car form large pack during a race it be not uncommon to see thirty or more lead change during a race this also be the source of the big one when a driver crash usually they take that pack with they during the coke zero of the car crash this be a safety concern that have puzzle nascar however an unexpected consequence of the introduction of the car of tomorrow and re pave of daytona and talladega track surface have be the separation of the pack into two car pair since the season nascar cup car now have fuel injection instead of carburetor but restrictor plate be still be use begin in nascar rewrote the rule to effectively force the ford and chrysler specialty car out of the competition by limit they to i the car affect by this rule include the ford talladega mercury spoiler ii dodge charger dodge charger daytona and the plymouth superbird this rule be so effective in limit performance that only one car that season ever attempt to run in this configuration in nascar handicap the large engine with a restrictor plate by nascar phase in a rule to lower the maximum engine displacement from cubic inch liter to its present cubic inch liter the transition be not complete until and coincide with american manufacturer end factory support of racing and the oil crisis after a series of flip and dangerous crash in the nascar begin require all car to run a restrictor plate at daytona and talladega the restrictor plate limit air into the engine reduce horsepower and speed at these track from mph to mph at these race in addition to the restrictor plate there be a variety of other technical rule and regulation to keep the car stable and on the track in addition to these technical rule restrictor plate race and road course be the only race where nascar enforce track limit at the high speed superspeedway track limit be mark by a double yellow line separate the apron from the racing surface exceed track limit to advance one position be subject to a drive through penalty or if the foul occur on the last lap that car will be relegate to the last car on the lead lap in official race result the superspeedway track limit often refer as the yellow line rule have be part of considerable criticism and controversy such as when regan smith be strip of second place finish at the amp energy follow a last lap pass attempt that go below the line and controversy surround the finish of the yellawood with former driver turn television coverage pundit dale jarrett and dale earnhardt jr the latter be involve in a track limit controversy at the aaron call for the repeal of the rule if track limit be violate on road course such as not make a chicane enforce at watkins glen daytona and charlotte road course driver must stop at an assign point of the circuit or face a drive through penalty the nascar cup series and xfinity series mandate the use of restrictor plate at daytona international speedway and talladega superspeedway from to the plate be put into use in as a result of a wreck in the winston at talladega that involve the car of bobby allison crash into the front stretch catch fence at a high enough speed to destroy almost foot of the fence and put the race under a red flag condition for two hour the follow race at talladega that year would be run with a small carburetor however nascar mandate the use of the restrictor plate at the end of the season the restriction be in the interest of driver and fan safety because speed high than the mph range use for daytona and talladega risk car turn over through sheer aerodynamic force alone the severity of crash at high speed be also much great show by telemetry reading of wreck such as elliott sadler at pocono raceway and michael mcdowell at texas motor speedway that be far high than register on restrictor plate track driver such as rusty wallace have cite datum show that the roof flap use on the car can not keep they on the ground above mph the drawback to the use of the restrictor plate have be the increase size of pack of car cause by the decrease power couple with the drag the vehicle naturally produce at daytona and talladega most race be mar by at least one wreck usually refer to as the big one as car rarely become separate talladega have be consider the more likely track for these instance to occur as the track be incredibly wide enough to have three to four distinct line of car run side by side with the new pavement at daytona three wide racing become far easy and multi car wreck become more common the daytona see a record number of caution include an early car pile up these wreck tend to be single out for criticism despite multicar crash at other track and the generally great severity of impact on non restrict track in addition the pack be far small in through until more team master the nuance of this kind of race and improve their car and driver accordingly the sprint cup season be the last complete cup season with carburet engine at the end of the season nascar announce that it would change to an electronic fuel injection system for the racing season the injection system use by nascar be a different system from that use in indycar racing and other motorsport series the efi system that nascar put into use be compatible with the old restrictor plate allow nascar to continue to use they to keep the speed low at the superspeedway and save cost for race team the restrictor plate be bolt beneath a throttle body that sit in the same place as the former carburetor taper spacer have be use in nascar cup series since when a inch aluminum block reduce horsepower from about to approximately at several track the rule package mandate those same sized spacer at all track less than mile a inch spacer will be use at all oval track mile and above which will decrease engine horsepower to about the last race with the original restrictor plate be the daytona after that race the car move to a variable sized tapered spacer already use at all other track with the exception that the spacer would have small hole than the one use at the small track to ensure speed stay under mph the shape of the spacer help a car funnel more air smoothly into the manifold increase fuel performance while ensure airflow be still restrict with that change nascar also mandate the use of large rear spoiler large front splitter and specially place front end aero duct the combination of those feature increase drag on the car counteract the increase horsepower keep the car close to the speed they be run prior to the switch to the tapered spacer while the racing quality noticeably improve and pass be make easy with large horsepower and big run speed also noticeably increase past mph and even into mph range reason for restrictor plate there have be four era that nascar use restrictor plate the first use come in as part of a transition from the seven liter era cubic inch to the six liter era cubic inch engine follow testing and input from driver such as david pearson bobby isaac and bobby allison nascar mandate the use of a restrictor plate for the big block seven liter engine small block engine in the cubic inch range be exempt from the plate the first car to race with a small block engine be dick brooks at the daytona where he run a dodge daytona with a cid engine the transition period last until when the current cubic inch limit be impose and nascar eliminate the cubic inch engine as the early use of restrictor plate be consider a transitional process and as not every car use restrictor plate this be not what most fan call restrictor plate race the second use come follow the crash of bobby allison at the winston at talladega superspeedway allison buick lesabre blow a tire go into the tri oval at spin around and become airborne fly tail first into the catch fencing while the car do not enter the grandstand it tear down nearly foot of fencing and fly debris injure several spectator after a summer where the two subsequent superspeedway race be run with small carburetor cubic foot per minute cfm instead of cfm prove to be inadequate to sufficiently slow the car nascar impose restrictor plate again this time at the two fast circuit both superspeedway daytona for all nascar sanctioned race and talladega for cup race the automobile racing club of america also enforce restrictor plate at their event at the two track in when the busch grand national series begin race at talladega the plate be implement in keep with their use at daytona nascar concern with speed because of power to weight ratio result in restrictor plate at other track the goody dash series know now as the iscar series with its new ownership use restrictor plate at bristol during at least the last year of the series existence when the car be use six cylinder engine compare to the traditional four cylinder engine in addition to their daytona race however restrictor plate be not initially use for camp world truck series truck rather aerodynamic air intake reduction through the use of a cfm carburetor and eventually a tapered carburetor spacer be implement for those race combine with the aerodynamic disadvantage of the truck this allow nascar to avoid the use of such equipment for the truck until in the nationwide series now know as xfinity series and truck series begin implementation of taper spacer in the engine to restrict power compare to sprint cup car at all nn and nct race both these nascar series now use a restrictor plate and taper spacer at the two track the third use come in follow fatal crash of adam petty and kenny irwin jr at the new hampshire international speedway during the may busch series and july winston cup series race respectively nascar adopt a one inch cm restrictor plate to slow the car head towards the tight turn as part of a series of reform to alleviate stuck throttle problem which be allege to have cause both fatal crash for the winston cup race it be use just once at the dura lube jeff burton lead all lap in the ensue race despite a car two abreast battle in the first ten lap a dramatic charge past car in lap by john andretti who finish seventh and two charge by bobby labonte in the final lap where he take the lead but burton beat he back to the stripe the use of restrictor plate intend as an emergency measure pende a more permanent replacement in any event be discontinue at new hampshire for the follow race for cup only however the modified still use a restrictor plate because the speed be too great for that class of racecar without they the track have since be change with safe barrier to improve race safety restrictor plate remain a permanent fixture on the modified and the racing have often break official lead change for lap of competition rusty wallace test a car at talladega superspeedway without a restrictor plate in reach a top speed of in the backstretch and a one lap average of while admit excitement at the achievement wallace also concede there no way we could be out there race at those speed it would be insane to think we could have a pack of car out there do that in follow a series of uncompetitive race at indianapolis motor speedway nascar begin a series of test for the xfinity series use a small restrictor plate than use at daytona and talladega and aerodynamic aid after the test be successful the rule package be impose for the race at indianapoli for the package be be use at indianapolis michigan and pocono for the xfinity series and in the all star race in the cup series the competitive quality of restrictor plate race a frequent criticism of restrictor plate be the enormous size of pack in the racing with big one wreck as note above single out for condemnation despite the great violence of small crash on unrestricted track in restrictor plate race the pack have bring about an often enormous increase in positional passing at talladega superspeedway the sprint cup car have break official lead change sixteen time from onward include both sprint cup race at talladega which have official lead change in the regulation lap the aaron have lead change but the the race win pass by kevin harvick be on the last lap of the third attempt at a green white checker finish daytona international speedway have generally be less competitive because the age of the asphalt the track be repave in and again in have reduce grip for the car and thus handling have impede pass ability to a significant extent the new hampshire race be condemn because jeff burton lead wire to wire the plate be single out as impede the ability to pass a criticism contradict by the use of restrictor plate in a busch north support race the day before where the lead change seven time in lap and by the highly competitive nature of restrictor plate modify race as note above the also see a car battle for third in the first ten lap and a burst by car from john andretti the criticism stem from the reduction in throttle response bring by the restriction the reduction in throttle response however have never be show to have impede the ability to pass the criticism be shoot down in the first modern plate race the daytona as the lead change time officially and see several burst where the lead change several time a lap and also several burst of sustained side by side racing notably in the final lap between bobby allison darrell waltrip neil bonnett and buddy baker say waltrip before the race i feel as a driver now i can do more than i could before the plate now instead of a car just blast by i with a burst of speed and a lot of horsepower he get to think his way he get to drive his way around i in the transitional year where the seven liter engine cu in have restrictor plate daytona and talladega break official lead change six time while michigan international speedway break official lead change in both of its race
